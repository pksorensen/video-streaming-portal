# Streaming Recording Fix Summary

## Problem
After a stream ends, recorded broadcasts were stuck in "processing" state and couldn't be played back.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Uncaught Exception**: A timeout callback in `recordingManager.js` was trying to access a recording object after it was already deleted from memory, causing:
   ```
   TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'killed')
   at Timeout._onTimeout (/app/src/utils/recordingManager.js:198:44)
   ```

2. **Exit Code Handling**: FFmpeg exits with code 255 when terminated via SIGTERM (normal behavior when stopping a stream), but the system was treating this as a failure instead of a successful completion.

3. **UI Display Logic**: The frontend only recognized 'completed' status and displayed all other statuses (including 'failed') as "Processing".

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed the Timeout Access Error
**File**: `/workspace/video-streaming/src/utils/recordingManager.js`

- Added null checks in the timeout callback to verify the recording still exists before accessing properties
- Added cleanup of the timeout when recording is finalized to prevent unnecessary execution

### 2. Corrected Exit Code Handling
**File**: `/workspace/video-streaming/src/utils/recordingManager.js`

- Updated status logic to treat exit code 255 (SIGTERM) as a successful completion
- Changed from: `exitCode === 0 ? 'completed' : 'failed'`
- To: `(exitCode === 0 || exitCode === 255) ? 'completed' : 'failed'`

### 3. Enhanced UI Status Display
**File**: `/workspace/video-streaming/public/js/app.js`

- Updated the recording card to properly handle all three states: 'completed', 'failed', and 'processing'
- Added distinct visual indicators for each state:
  - ✅ Completed (green badge)
  - ❌ Failed (red badge)
  - ⏳ Processing (yellow badge)
- Updated button states to reflect the recording status properly

## Result
- Recordings now properly transition to "Completed" status when streams end
- No more uncaught exceptions that could crash the server
- Clear visual feedback for recording states
- Recordings can be played back and downloaded once completed
